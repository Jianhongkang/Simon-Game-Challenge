* Simon Game developed with JavaScript, HTML and CSS
* How to play the game:
	- Press any keyboard key to start the game.
	- The game will flash one color each round.
	- The user must attempt to pick the colours which were flashed by the game (the colours must be selected in the same sequence as flashed by the game).
	- If a wrong colour is selected it will be game over for the user (the user can then press any key to restart the game).
